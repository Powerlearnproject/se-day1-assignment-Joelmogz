Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the application of engineering principles and tools in the development and maintainance of high quality software systems. Its role is important in the creation of software applications and systems in the modern life such as health care

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. Introduction to programming langauges- this milestone led to the discovery of new programming languages such as c++
2. Development of software engineering as an engineering principle- the milestone led to software development to become an engineering principle leading to new methodologies
3. Rise of agile milestones-The milestone led to the emergence of agile methodologies who deliver high quality software systems that meets the users needs

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. Requirements-gathering and documenting user needs and requirements
2. Design- creating high level designs of software architecture and user interface
3. Implementation-writing codes thats meets the design
4. Testing-conducting tests to ensure the software meets the quakity standards and functional requirements
5. Deployment-releasing software to users
6. Maintainance-providing support and updates and enhancements of softwares after deployment


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1. Waterfall- sequencial approach with distinct phases such as requirement
2. Agile methodologies-iteterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility and response to change

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1. software developer-writes codes and implements software solutions
2. quality assuarance engineer-ensures software quality by designing and excuting testing plans
3. project manager-oversees the planning and execution and delivery of software projects

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
1. IDEs such as visual basic code provides comprehensive tools in writing of codes
2. VCS such as git are software tools that track source of codes and coordinate work among team members

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1. Requirements changing ovetime-use agile methodology
2. Managing software complexity-use modular and component-based design to breakdown systems into managable pieces

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1. Units-Testing individual compents of software
2. Integration-testing interactions between different components
3. System-testing the entire software system as a whole
4. Acceptance-testing software against the users requirements ensuring it meets users needs
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering-is crafting of questions to get the best responses from the AI models. It is important in helping one get a more clear and specific answer rather than a general answer

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
A vague prompt is like translate "I am a boy" instead one can say translate "I am a boy to spanish"-here you can see a vague prompt can give u a general answer as it can translate to many different languages but since we have given it a clear and specific question whereby we want it to be translated into only a spanish language
